# Reproducing plots and loss landscape cuts from the paper *Deep Ensembles: A Loss Landscape Perspective* (https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02757)

This is a Colab where you can reproduce the basic plots from our paper: https://github.com/stanislavfort/ensemble-landscape-cuts/blob/main/basic_loss_cuts_in_pytorch.ipynb The code trains the models only for a few epochs to make it run fast. That's sufficient for demonstrating the basic features of the loss landscape cut, however, if you were to reproduce the plots from the paper directly, set the number of epochs to whatever is done there.

The plots you can expect look like this:
